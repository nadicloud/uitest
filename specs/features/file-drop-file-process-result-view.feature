    Scenario Outline: I can download the full analysis report of a processed file
        Given I have processed a supported file <supportedFile>
        When I view result and click on Download Analysis Report
        Then The full analysis report is downloaded and available as <analysisReport>

    Scenario Outline: I can see the result of a repaired file with the issues removed
        When I process a supported sanitisation file <activeContentFile> with remedy items
        Then the notification message is displayed as <processStatus>
        And I see the list of sanitised active contents with expected <activeContent>
        And I see the list of objects and structures repaired with expected <repairedObject>
        Examples:
            | activeContentFile         | activeContent                              | repairedObject      | processStatus                |
            | src/data/input/file1.docx | Internal Hyperlinks present in CT_Bookmark | APP segment removed | Your file has been processed |

        Then the notification message is displayed as <processStatus>
        And I see the list of objects and structures not repaired <nonrepairedObject>
