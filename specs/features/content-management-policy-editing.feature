Feature: Content Management Policy Editing

As a admin I need to validate that policy content flags can be edited in order to confirm that the solution works as expected

    Background:
        Given I am logged into the portal
        Given I am on current policy screen


    @TEST-153
    Scenario: A user selecting the "Current Policy" in the navigation panel will be taken to the current policy page
        When I click on Current Policy in the navigation panel
        Then I am taken to the current policy page

    Scenario Outline: A user can cancel any updates that they have done to the policy by pressing cancel
        When I change one of the <ContentFlags> for required file types <FileType> to <ChangedFlagType>
        And I press the Cancel button
        Then The <ContentFlags> for file types <FileType> defaults to <CurrentFlagType>
        Examples:
          | FileType   | ContentFlags    | CurrentFlagType    | ChangedFlagType |
          | word       | embeddedFiles   | disallow           | sanitise        |
