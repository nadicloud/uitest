Feature: request-history-filtering-by-file-type
    As a admin I need to validate file requests history filtering by file extension in order to confirm that the solution works as expected

    Background:
        Given I am logged into the ui

    @TEST-163
    Scenario Outline: filter the log by file type
        Given I have navigated to the Request History page
        When I click on the Add Filter button and add a file type filter as '<filter>'
        Then the result list shows files with the selected types as '<filteredFile>'
        Examples:
            | filter | filteredFile |
            | docx   | Docx         |
            | xls    | Xls          |
            | pptx   | Pptx         |
            | rtf    | Rtf          |
            | png    | Png          |
