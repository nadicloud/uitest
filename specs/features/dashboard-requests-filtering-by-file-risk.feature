Feature: dashboard-requests-filtering-by-file-risk
    As a admin I need to validate file requests filtering by risk in order to confirm that the solution works as expected

    Background:
        Given I am logged into the ui
        And I have navigated to the analytics page

   
    @TEST-192
    Scenario Outline: I can filter the risk legend
        When I tick select from the '<chart>' legend a file risk '<fileRisk>'
        Then the '<chart>' is updated to only show the filtered risk '<filteredRisk>'
        Examples:
            | chart      | fileRisk     | filteredRisk |
            | pie        | Safe         | Safe         |
            | pie        | Blocked      | Blocked      |
            | pie        | Dangerous    | Dangerous    |
            | pie        | Unclassified | Unclassified |
            | line graph | Safe         | Safe         |
            | line graph | Blocked      | Blocked      |
            | line graph | Dangerous    | Dangerous    |
            | line graph | Checked      | Checked      |
            | line graph | Unclassified | Unclassified |
