    Scenario Outline: I can add a new user to the ui
        Given I have logged into the ui and navigated to the Users page
        When I add a new user with a valid '<email>'
        Then The new user record is saved
        Examples:
            | name    | email                    |
            | tester1 | tester1@glasswalltest.co |

    @TEST-172
    Scenario Outline: I can delete another user from the page
        Given I have logged into the ui and navigated to the Users page
        When I delete an existing user '<name>'
        Then The user record is no longer available
        Examples:
            | name    | email                    |
